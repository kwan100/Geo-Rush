# Geo-Rush

* Collaborated with a team of 5 programmers to develop a level-based 3D Wall-Runner game in Unity using C#
* Iteratively improved the game via crowd-sourced feedback, achieved by analyzing user-engagement through visual data
* Strategically constructed 3D obstacle courses to incentivize the full extent of the game mechanics and user-experience
